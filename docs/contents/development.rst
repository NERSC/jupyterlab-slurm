If you want to setup a development installation of the extension to configure/customize for your own use, or if you would like to contribute to further development of the extension, head over to the jupyterlab-slurm `repository <https://github.com/NERSC/jupyterlab-slurm>`_. There you can follow the directions for a development install, and submit issues/pull requests.
